description: Check Eleventy project status (build, server, files)
---

Check the current status of the Eleventy project.

This command shows:
1. Current working directory
2. Whether `_site/` exists (built files)
3. Dev server status (port 8080)
4. Last build time
5. Recent changes in `src/`

**When to use:**
- Start of session to understand project state
- Before making changes
- Debugging server issues
- Checking if rebuild is needed

Helps answer:
- Is the dev server running?
- Are built files up to date?
- What's the current project state?
